# This is my SBA Project
For this Project, I was thinking about launching a new business.
A coffee business , I was inspired by my Culture.

## How did I Proceed
I worked on a basic websiste with three pages:
* Home <br/>
[//]: # (This is the main page) <br/>
[//]: # (You will find the logo that I create myself on Canva and it's also a button link to direct you to Home) <br/>
[//]: # (You will find the NavBar with my three links to the three pages) <br/>
[//]: # (A Good Description of the business, and a carousel that explains the process of making coffee) <br/>
* Login <br/>
[//]: # (You will see a login form and a comment text area) <br/>
* Table <br/>
[//]: # (You will find all the prices and Shipping fees, an Order now gif) <br/>
[//]: # (And also a link if you want to know more about this culture and the footer) <br/>
You can acces all three pages by clicking on the link in the NavBar. <br/>

## What did I use
I use HTML for the structure (Flexbox, Bootstrap) CSS for the styling (All pages are uniform in the color)
Canva (To design the logo and make it show how it was on my mind ) and all the ressources I could find on the Internet
